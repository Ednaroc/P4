# Project 4: Optimize an Existing Website

## Scenario
Your friend Mike is a freelance web designer who lives in Atlanta. Many local shops have outdated websites, so he approached a few and landed his first clients.
But now he would like potential customers to find him when they Google for local freelance web designers to hire.
With your new understanding of quality web development, you realize that his current portfolio website is not optimized for SEO and can be improved with better keyword content, structure, and speed optimization.
You also suspect that some users with disabilities will encounter obstacles with his website, posing accessibility issues.

With access to the website files, you’re ready to get started. You decide to proceed as follows:
1. Audit the existing website by identifying relevant SEO and accessibility issues, noting an explanation and a credible reference (documentation, research paper, journal…) for each one. Your audit will include a selection of at least 10 actions to take to improve the website’s accessibility and/or SEO (including size and speed).
2. Apply your recommendations to the code and submit the full source code of the improved website. The W3C HTML and CSS validator should not reveal any errors. 
3. Demonstrate that your adjustments have improved the website by providing a before-and-after comparison of the results from Google’s Lighthouse tool, accounting for all action taken to optimize the website.

## Deliverables
* __An audit report__ using the provided template, including a selection of 10 SEO recommended actions (checked in the column “Action recommended”)
* __The link to a public Git repo__ with the full source code for the improved website.
